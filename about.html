              <br>
              Within sub-Saharan Africa, we also see an increase in the adoption of technology to automate processes in many sectors. However, healthcare has unfortunately not enjoyed the same level of attention and investment until now. 
             <br>
             As the global community reacts to the current COVID19 pandemic, these underdeveloped healthcare infrastructures are laid bare. There is a cultural and social transformation taking place and we are determined to play a leading role in this technological revolution within the healthcare domain, in our region of focus.

            We are a group of individuals united by a shared passion to provide high-quality digital solutions to these underserved health workers and the communities they serve. More than 75% of our core team lives or has lived in Sub-Saharan Africa and have been directly impacted with devastating effect by the inefficiencies of the health systems currently in place. This has served as a motivation for us to pursue our mission diligence and focus.

        <p>
            Our story was set in motion some 40 years ago when Lorna Kingston, later followed by her younger sister Shirley Assandey, moved to the remote village of Becedi, in the South-East of Cote d'Ivoire to support the care of at-risk pre/postnatal patients.

              <p>From the 80’s to the early 2000s, Shirley drove the execution of immunization programs against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, tuberculosis, yellow fever, and measles with considerable short and long term success. </p>
              <h4>REDUCED INFANT MORTALITY WITH PREVENTATIVE CARE</h4>
              <p>In 1987, ½ of all deaths were children under the age of five. Shirley and her elder sister Lorna Kingston, along with their team, lead a Maternal Health Care (MHC) center that contributed significantly to the betterment of these conditions by transferring knowledge of effective healthcare education and delivery.</p>
              <h4>PREPAREDNESS FOR OUTBREAKS</h4>
              <p>Healthcare education, immunization programs and improvements in clinical processes and sanitary standards were all building blocks that lead to the country’s preparedness for outbreaks such as Ebola in 2014 being judged a success by the global health community</p>

              <p class="mt-5">Muriel, the daughter of Philomene Sedji (founder’s nanny & close family friend) was just 24 when she passed away in a top tier hospital in CI. She is named after Shirley Muriel Assandey. The reason for her visit was an injured leg (she fell and her blister became infected), but tragically lost her life during routine treatment. Muriel had no medical history available that might have shown any underlying conditions or allergies, nor could the center provide records of her passing for a proper postmortem to take place.  Muriel is a tragic example of many lives lost due to a lack of data to drive critical decision making at the point of care and beyond. Suspected cause of death: Buruli ulcer. Muriel’s story and Shirley’s body of work are the primary motivators driving Rory Assandey and the La Ruche team to carry the torch, and make a true impact. </p>
